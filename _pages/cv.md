Education
======
* B.S. in **Opto-Electronics Science and Engineering**, Zhejiang University, 2025(expected)

Research experience
======
Boston University (Advisor: **Prof. Jixin Cheng**):
  * Extracting MIP signals from water background using PLS for lipid synthesis study
    * Developed a novel background removal algorithm tailored for hyperspectral data to effectively isolate signal peaks from the background noise
    * Implemented the method to MIP data, successfully extracting peaks while preserving the spatial and intensity characteristics of the original signals
    * Demonstrated that the new algorithm outperformed traditional subtraction method in both accuracy and robustness, providing a versatile solution for background removal in hyperspectral imaging data
    * Detected fatty acid unsaturation in cancer cells via MIP image process
  
Zhejiang University (Advisor: **Prof. Huafeng Liu**)
  * Deep learning framework for enhancing TOF performance of PET detector
    * Gained expertise in deep learning-based PET detector timing algorithm combining Transformer and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
    * Transformed the original regression network to a classification network, trying to enhance Coincidence Time Resolution (CTR)
    * Leveraged a simulation system to generate comprehensive training data

Zhejiang University 
  * Developed an eye-tracking interaction system based on Conv-LSTM using DVS data
  * Created a program of image processing for silicon wafer counting based on Matlab
  * Contributed to PCB circuit design and programming
  * Designed optical lenses based on Zemax
