Education
======
* B.E. in **Opto-Electronics Science and Engineering**, Zhejiang University, 2025(expected)

Research experience
======
Boston University (Advisor: **Prof. Jixin Cheng**):
  * Extracting MIP signals from water background using PLS for lipid synthesis study
    * Developed a novel background removal algorithm tailored for hyperspectral data to effectively isolate signal peaks from the background noise; Implemented the method on MIP and SRS data
    * Extracted peaks while preserving the spatial and intensity characteristics of the original signals; Demonstrated better performance with better accuracy and robustness over traditional subtraction method
    * Provided a versatile solution for background removal in hyperspectral imaging data; Established a standardized procedure for detecting signals of specific cellular structures
    * Detected fatty acid unsaturation in cancer cells via MIP image process; Separated the lipids for statistical research; Verified the hypothesis through quantitative analysis
  
Zhejiang University (Advisor: **Prof. Huafeng Liu**)
  * Deep learning for enhancing reconstruction performance of PET via TOF information
    * Leveraged a Linux-based simulation system to generate comprehensive training data for machine learning
    * Gained expertise in Deep learning based Positron Emission Tomography (PET) reconstruction algorithm via Time Of Flight (TOF) information combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer
    * Transformed original regression network to a classification network to reduce Coincidence Time Resolution (CTR)

Zhejiang University 
  * Developed an eye-tracking interaction system based on Conv-LSTM using DVS data
  * Created an image processing algorithm for silicon wafer counting based on Matlab
  * Contributed to a PCB circuit design and programming project
