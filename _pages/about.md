I am a senior undergraduate student major in **Opto-Electronics Science and Engineering** from [Zhejiang University](http://opt.zju.edu.cn). 

My research interest includes **Computational imaging, Signal processing, and Machine learning**. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Jixin Cheng](https://sites.bu.edu/cheng-group/) at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu) as a summer intern student. I had the privilege to work with [Prof.Huafeng Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JbkbGvEAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Zhejiang University](http://opt.zju.edu.cn).

You can find my CV here: [Tianyu Xia's Curriculum Vitae](assets/CV_Tianyu Xia.pdf).
