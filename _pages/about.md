I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in **Opto-Electronics Science and Engineering** at [Zhejiang University](http://opt.zju.edu.cn). 

My research interests include **Computational imaging, Signal processing, Imaging instrumentation, and Machine learning**. My goal is to integrate my knowledge of optics with my experience in machine learning and image processing to conduct cutting-edge research.

My previous research focused on image processing. I have been very fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Jixin Cheng](https://sites.bu.edu/cheng-group/) at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu) as a summer intern.And I have had the privilege to work with [Prof.Huafeng Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JbkbGvEAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Zhejiang University](http://opt.zju.edu.cn).

You are welcome to view my [CV](https://xty-25.github.io/Tianyu-Xia/cv/) and contact me via **email**.
